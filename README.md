## agile-final-project

This repository was created as part of the **Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum** course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).  

It demonstrates my hands-on practice with Scrum, including backlog management, sprint planning, and completing the final project using a Kanban workflow.
